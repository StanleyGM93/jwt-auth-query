# Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

This repo contains a working app that includes CRUD operations for fruit. For full use of this site a user has to sign in using OAuth which is a 3rd party provider of authentification. This was a project designed to show how to implement the basics of authentification and authorisation. I look forward to improving my skills in this area.
